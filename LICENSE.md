## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use this for my personal blog?
**Yes!** Personal blogs are covered under the free MIT license.

### Can I use this for my startup's company blog?
**Yes**, if the blog itself doesn't generate revenue directly. However, if you're building blogging tools/services for others, that would require a commercial license.

### Can I use this for client work?
If you're building a blog for a client and charging them, that requires a commercial license.

### Can I modify the code?
**Yes!** Both licenses allow modifications. The MIT license requires you to keep the license notice. Commercial licenses come with additional support options.

### What if I'm not sure which license I need?
When in doubt, please reach out at your@email.com and we'll help you determine the right license for your use case.
